This is a WIP [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) front-end* for GLOT, a conversational language learning system.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

*I use NextJS for some of the "backend" features as well but the backend with the machine learning features is in Flask.
